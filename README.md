# To-Do List Application

A simple yet effective todo list application that supports all the CRUD functionalities.

This project was created to test my fundamental knowledge in Express.js, Mongoose ODM and EJS. So, anybody who has just learned the basics of full stack development and is willing to create a simple project to test his skills can use this project for his reference.

## Project Setup

Assuming you’ve already installed Node.js. Simply fork and clone this repository on your local machine and then run these basic commands.

Cd over to the folder and make it your working directory.
```bash
  cd ToDo-List-application
```

Use the npm init command to create a package.json file for your application. For more information on how package.json works, see Specifics of npm’s package.json handling. (Optional)
```bash
  npm init
  entry point: (server.js)
```

Run this command to install all the dependencies.
```bash
  npm i
```

And all set.. now simply use node or nodemon to run the application.
```bash
  node server.js
```
Better option.. use nodemon
```bash
  npm i -g nodemon
  nodemon server.js
```
